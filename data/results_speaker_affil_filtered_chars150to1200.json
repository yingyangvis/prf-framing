A price was put on sulfur emissions from power stations and people said, ‘They’ll install scrubbers to deal with the stripping of sulfur. That will be very expensive. How will everybody cope?’ In truth, what happened was that they innovated, so they switched to coal with lower sulfur. They innovated and, yes, they did install those scrubbers, but because power stations were demanding the scrubbers in large numbers there was innovation and volume that brought the price down. What we should learn from this example is very clear: a price signal sends a message to business to innovate and to reduce pollution.

For all of the false claims that have been made about carbon pricing and car making, the truth is that the impact of carbon pricing on car making is less than a variation of half a cent in the value of the Australian dollar—that is, it is a very minor impact. What it means is that the major impact that is weighing on car making in this country is the strength of the Australian dollar—the fact that we have seen a 50 per cent appreciation in our currency over the last few years. That means that you actually need to have sophisticated, thought-through policies about how to hold manufacturing in this country and not have our economy hollowed out. That means you need to focus on the pivotal role of car manufacturing, because car making is such a bringer of the skills and capacities that you need to sustain manufacturing generally.","helpful":-9.075251631953142,"unhelpful":0.5267387017553119,"diff":-9.6019903337084536,"speaker":"Julia Eileen Gillard","date":"2013-06-19","text_length":1077},{"text":"I was asked about jobs; I was asked about manufacturing.

Again and again this week we have seen a desperate government trying to claw its way back into political relevance with an advertising blitz the like of which this country has never seen. They spent $36 million on a carbon tax which they will not even name—$36 million advertising that which dare not speak its name: the carbon tax. They spent $20 million advertising the National Broadband Network and they spent $12 million advertising the education cash splash. They are even sending letters to millions of Australians: 'Extra cash for you. You have just received some extra money from the Australian government. This advance is just the start. There is more to come. From the middle of next year you will get extra cash. Don't worry, you don't need to make a new claim. This assistance will come automatically just like the cash you have just had. PS: This is just part of the extra help the government is giving.' And they never mentioned the carbon tax!

Let me give you one example. Ten years ago, in 2007, there was a political consensus in an election, when John Howard and Kevin Rudd both went to the election committed to having an emissions trading scheme—a market based solution to drive down emissions. A decade later, we still don't have a solution. The government has been in place now for five years without a policy.

At a $29-a-tonne carbon tax, our emissions go up from 578 million tonnes now to 621 million in 2020. It gets worse. At a $131-a-tonne carbon tax in 2050, we do not get an 80 per cent reduction in emissions; we actually get a six per cent reduction in emissions. Our emissions in 2050, on the government's own figures, will have gone from 578 million tonnes to 545 million tonnes. So all of those bold claims in the Prime Minister's speech yesterday—all of that big chest-thumping talk of a massive reduction in emissions as a result of this tax—are utterly wrong and disproven on the basis of the government's own documents. We are not reducing our emissions; we are just engaging in a massive transfer of wealth from this country to carbon traders overseas.","helpful":-21.117833449332466,"unhelpful":-2.9867969447801443,"diff":-18.13103650455232,"speaker":"Tony John Abbott","date":"2011-09-14","text_length":903},{"text":"What matters is if you actually reduce emissions.
