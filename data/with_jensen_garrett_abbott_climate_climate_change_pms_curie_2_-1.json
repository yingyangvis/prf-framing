They are sceptical about responses to climate change that would put Australia at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. They are also sceptical about ruling out solutions that are clearly in the long-term interests of this country.

From day one—that is, from July next year—an effective carbon price will apply to the fuel used by domestic airlines. To maintain the competitiveness of Australian carriers, it will not apply to the fuel they use when flying internationally, at least until there is a global carbon price. We are also allowing large liquid fuel users, such as airlines, to voluntarily opt in from 2013. This is because a carbon market already operates in the EU and our international carriers may want the ability to trade across markets. It is worth repeating: a market for the price on carbon already exists and Australian companies competing internationally want the ability to trade across markets. The carbon price will have only a small impact on domestic airfares, less than many of the extra fees airlines already charge. For example, it is expected to add about $2 to the cost of a seat on a flight between Sydney and Melbourne and around $1 on a flight between Sydney and Armidale. Any increase would occur against the backdrop that flying is five times more affordable today than it was two decades ago as a result of earlier Labor reforms such as the deregulation of the domestic aviation market.","helpful":-11.512962649124869,"unhelpful":-8.6068524535070541,"speaker":"Anthony Norman Albanese","date":"2011-10-11","diff":-2.9061101956178153},{"text":"Those opposite seem to guffaw about costs.

However, if a scheme operates whereby the government pays the firm to reduce its emissions intensity, leaving aside the impact on the budget and the demand therefore for higher taxes, there is firstly going to be a substantial and contentious debate about what the correct baseline is, and then whether it will actually be reduced. Because most capital equipment, especially in the energy sector, has a life running into many decades, as long as 50 years in some cases, the business sector is going to require assurance that any government subsidy will match the life of the asset—so running well beyond 2020. In other words, any scheme has to have a lifetime which matches the lifetime of the investment. If government wants business to make long-term investments to lower emissions, its commitment must be long term as well, which is why a subsidy scheme which terminates in 2020 will achieve very little.

In December 2005 the environment minister said the Kyoto protocol was ‘almost buried’. Yet recently he said, ‘There has been no stronger supporter of Kyoto than the Howard government.’ Of course, Australia is one of only two industrialised countries that have not ratified Kyoto, and we are the highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. While the Prime Minister recently acknowledged that climate change was not a myth, he said the debate over climate change was a choice between the economy and the environment. Unbelievably, given the threat that climate change poses, once again the Prime Minister has chosen to cast our response to this threat in ideological terms. Just like with the wheat for weapons scandal, this is a government that governs in its own political interest, not in the national interest.","helpful":-16.363468144861372,"unhelpful":-15.487160632029987,"speaker":"Anthony Norman Albanese","date":"2006-02-15","diff":-0.87630751283138508},{"text":"Those opposite have on this question.

And we can say to a business, ‘We will impose on you the cost of not polluting a river or a stream or a harbour and that will be an additional cost to you, but, nonetheless, there will be a benefit to our environment and an overall benefit to our community.’ But if we say to a business in Australia, ‘We are imposing on you a cost per tonne of CO2 emitted,’ and if the consequence of the imposition of that cost is that that business becomes uneconomic in this country because the businesses with which it competes in other nations are not bearing such a cost then the only consequence is that less CO2 is emitted from Australia and more CO2 is emitted from other countries. There are any number of examples of this right across the industrial spectrum in Australia, but probably the best, the most glaring, example is that of the coal industry. That is our largest export, and the industry is not being treated as other emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries are under this scheme for appropriate compensation or appropriate allocation of free permits.

In Australia we have a government that refuses to engage in discussion about greenhouse gas emissions targets. What does this scepticism mean for the Great Barrier Reef? Even in a best-case scenario that we can limit CO to 550 parts per million, the consequences are devastating. A less than one degree Celsius rise in temperature would mean that 60 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef could be regularly bleached. A one-degree or two-degrees temperature rise would mean 58 to 81 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef is bleached every year and a two- to three-degrees temperature rise would mean that 97 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef would be bleached every year. We need a plan to address these issues, we need targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions and we need the economic instruments that would drive the move to clean energy, which is why we need a national emissions trading scheme.

He said that the jury was still out, and he was reinforced by many of his ministerial colleagues. And they wonder why, in the events which have unfolded since then, the Australian people doubt whether they have any credibility and standing on this matter whatsoever. Out of your mouth, Prime Minister, at this dispatch box, you confessed your own deep and continuing scepticism about the connection between human activity, greenhouse gas emissions and therefore climate change. And the Prime Minister wonders why the Australian people doubt him. Well, do you know something, Prime Minister?

How will everybody cope?’ In truth, what happened was that they innovated, so they switched to coal with lower sulfur. They innovated and, yes, they did install those scrubbers, but because power stations were demanding the scrubbers in large numbers there was innovation and volume that brought the price down. What we should learn from this example is very clear: a price signal sends a message to business to innovate and to reduce pollution.

We have done that in three specific areas under our economic stimulus strategy: first of all, to continue to take action in support of the stability of Australian financial markets, anchored in our guarantee to Australian deposit holders. On top of that, we are also investing in critical areas to support the Australian finance industry, most particularly through the Business Investment Partnership. We are, secondly, engaging in direct support to employment for 1½ million Australians who work in the Australian retail industry, through the support that we have provided to consumption and the payments we have made to pensioners, to carers, to veterans and to others, because those 1½ million jobs are important. On the debate just before about employment impacts across the economy: it has been important to see recent statements by some of our leading retailers about their plans to add to employment in the year ahead, which is remarkable given the stress which the economy generally is under as a consequence of the global recession. The third element of our strategy is to engage in long-term investment and infrastructure, in school building and in public housing, as well as energy insulation to ensure we are also doing our bit to draw down greenhouse gas emissions.

Yes, electricity has risen. It has risen for a number of reasons. It has risen partic­ularly because there is a need for more investment in electricity, including in electricity distribution. That investment is costly and it has been flowing through to electricity prices. And Australians have not got direct assistance to help them with the cost of that rising electricity.

The rubbish disappeared, according to some people. They thought it did not have an impact. Along that river, industries such as the sugar mills of Sydney pumped pollution into the atmosphere. That had an impact over a period of time whereby the river became one of the most polluted rivers. The costs of that pollution are now being borne by today's generation, who are spending more money to clean up that river than if an appropriate exercise had occurred then and there had been some foresight in the latter parts of the 19th century and the early parts of the 20th century. I see human induced climate change as a very similar principle.","helpful":-16.938990206343739,"unhelpful":-21.867192269475868,"speaker":"Anthony Norman Albanese","date":"2013-05-29","diff":4.9282020631321295},{"text":"This legislation is just not done—it is not ready; it is undercooked.

A key part of that has to be clean coal. That is recognised. Australia is playing a leading role and punching well above its weight in terms of clean coal technology development. The only other countries that are at the same cutting edge level as Australia are the Netherlands and the United States—because of its scale, it is obviously investing more than anyone else. Then we have forestry, which is another key issue. The member for Kingsford Smith derided the global forest initiative as a modest measure. This is the second largest source of emissions, but because it was not his idea he poured scorn on it. That is the vanity of the Labor Party’s approach to climate change. Finally, there is energy efficiency, which is a hugely complex area. There are great opportunities there. Which was the first country to announce the phase out of inefficient lighting? Australia. On those objective measures, Australia is playing a leading role in the battle against climate change.","helpful":-7.1001921789753624,"unhelpful":-12.76118516306658,"speaker":"Malcolm Bligh Turnbull","date":"2007-06-13","diff":5.6609929840912177},{"text":"Then the National Emissions Trading Taskforce established by the states and territories, and the Shergold report set up by the Howard government, embarked on extensive consultation processes.","helpful":-12.498042766600014,"unhelpful":-18.159212664146018,"speaker":"Julia Eileen Gillard","date":"2011-09-13","diff":5.6611698975460047},{"text":"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

But today they are pretending an interest in the words of unions, so let us listen to some from Peter Tighe and Earl Setches representing around 80,000 plumbers and electricians: 'Climate change is real and we are well placed to know that because in our industry we are providing the tools to meet the challenges. The costs of carbon pollution in this country have already been felt through water shortages, environmental degradation and pollution. A price on carbon will mean a further boom for jobs and more apprentices.'

Australian farmers right now are moving from chemical to organic fertilisers. They are reducing emissions, and they are doing it not because of a carbon tax but because it makes economic and environmental sense. Australian businesses are taking sensible measures to reduce their fuel bills and power bills. Linfox has better trained its drivers and, as a result, its total emissions have reduced by 35 per cent since 2007. Visy are moving from high-emitting power from the Latrobe Valley to power that they are producing by burning the garbage that cannot be recycled.

The report calls on the Howard government to contribute to work being done to find suitable geological carbon storage sites in New South Wales.

The report also calls for funding to support one or more new large-scale demonstration projects to test and perfect the technology. Again, Labor has committed $40 million for such a project, with the potential for the funding of further projects, and again the Howard government has refused to commit any funds.

Notwithstanding that investment from the Natural Heritage Trust, notwithstanding the fact that the community has rightly applied itself to the issue of conserving and protecting the environment, we still have a decline in our biodiversity—with terrestrial bird and mammal species listed as extinct, endangered or vulnerable rising by some 41 per cent between 1995 and 2005.

That task is being undertaken by nations like Japan and Germany, who are parties to the protocol, as are China, India and members of AP6 other than the US.","helpful":-13.215552279675956,"unhelpful":-24.683104672238198,"speaker":"Peter Robert Garrett","date":"2007-05-28","diff":11.467552392562242},{"text":"The environment minister is no world leader, nor is his government, and yet he has the gall to say that Australia is leading the world in tackling climate change. Let us just consider what he means when he says that Australia is leading the world by producing the facts in this matter of public importance. Australia is the second highest greenhouse polluter in the world; Australia’s emissions are growing at twice the global rate on average—or nearly; Australia has an effective additional renewable energy target of 0.9 per cent by 2020. In climate change programs since 1996 this government underspends—a $33.7 million underspend on clean energy programs in the last financial year. That does not sound like leading the world. Minister, your statement that Australia is leading the world on climate change is simply a fraud. It is hyperbole and it is spin, but the substance and the facts are that this government, in addressing climate change, is going backwards, and, in terms of Australia meeting its climate challenge, we are worse off now than we were when the government came to power.","helpful":-3.0036938452162074,"unhelpful":-14.55790835442458,"speaker":"Peter Robert Garrett","date":"2007-05-24","diff":11.554214509208371},{"text":"An international team of scientists working on the Great Barrier Reef has found a clear link between coral disease and warmer ocean temperatures. World-first research at 48 reefs spread along 1,500 kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef, combined with six years of satellite data on sea temperatures, has revealed ‘a highly significant relationship’ between ocean warming and the emergence of a disease known as white syndrome. And of course, ocean warming is a consequence of climate change. White syndrome is one of a number of unexplained coral diseases which scientists have observed to be on the increase globally in recent years. This is enough to make you weep. The Great Barrier Reef is dying before our very eyes and, frankly, it does not seem as if the Howard government gives a damn.","helpful":-11.200466219143948,"unhelpful":-22.976088015719018,"speaker":"Peter Robert Garrett","date":"2007-05-09","diff":11.77562179657507},{"text":"Sir Nicholas Stern, the eminent economist, spoke at the Press Club today. He made it crystal clear that early action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions was both necessary and desirable and that a failure to act now to address climate change will impose additional costs on the economy and on the community into the future. The message from Sir Nicholas Stern could not have been clearer. We need to have measures in place which take climate change seriously. We need to have measures in place which ensure that the market can begin to work effectively to enable businesses to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Most importantly, we need to recognise that all of us—the people in this parliament, the Howard government, which has been lax and in denial on climate change, and the citizens of Sydney—have a role to play.

The budget contains no initiatives that suggest that there is a glimmer of understanding that Australia’s future prosperity is linked directly to our willingness to engage with the climate change challenge and to provide business with a framework to do what it wants to do, which is to begin to reduce emissions now.

In particular, a national sustainability commissioner, who is able to look at a range of measures, evaluate progress towards goals and targets and assess whether or not taxpayers’ money is being put to good use, seems to be an eminently worthwhile and important suggestion.

That national consensus is evolving and growing, but there is one group missing: the Howard government. Howard government ministers still reject the science. The Howard government still has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, and the Howard government does not accept a comprehensive portfolio approach to producing energy into the longer term.
